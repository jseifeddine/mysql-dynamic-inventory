#   MySQL Dynamic Inventory to query particular hosts from 
#   Icinga DB selecting host.customvars and service_state output
#   for tracking and reporting on problematic hosts
#
#   Required columns: 
#   'inventory_group', 'inventory_hostname'
#
#   TLDR:
#   Besides the required columns, each column will be assigned 
#   as an ansible hostvar dynamically.
